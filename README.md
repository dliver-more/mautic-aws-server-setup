## Purpose
This repository contains a shell script and detailed setup instructions to automate the installation and configuration of **Mautic 5** on an AWS EC2 instance running **Ubuntu 24.04**. The goal is to simplify the deployment process and provide a reusable solution for others setting up Mautic in a cloud environment.

## What is Mautic?
Mautic is an open-source marketing automation platform that allows businesses to manage email campaigns, create landing pages, track user behavior, and much more. It is a powerful tool for marketers looking to automate their workflows and improve user engagement.

## What You Get
After running the provided script, you will have:
- An AWS EC2 server set up with **Mautic 5.2.1** and its admin panel.
- Configured to use **PHP 8.2**, **MariaDB 10.11**, and **Apache 2**.
- SSL secured via Let's Encrypt.
- A fully functional and secure environment ready for Mautic usage and customization.

## Prerequisites
Before running the shell script, ensure the following preparatory steps are completed:

### 1. Create a Static IP (Elastic IP) for the Server
- Allocate an Elastic IP in the AWS Management Console.
- Reserve this IP for the Mautic server to ensure consistent DNS routing.

### 2. Set Up DNS Records
- Create an **A record** pointing your Mautic domain (e.g., `mautic.example.com`) to the Elastic IP.
- Optionally, set up a **CNAME record** for any subdomains if needed.

### 3. Configure Security Groups
Define and attach appropriate security rules:
1. **SSH Access**:
   - Allow inbound traffic on port 22.
   - Restrict access to your IP or a small set of known IPs.
2. **Frontend Access**:
   - Open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) for admin and API usage.
   - During installation of SSL, public server access is required. **After installation this access should be removed**
   - Restrict access to authorized IPs if itâ€™s a private setup.
3. **API Access**:
   - Allow inbound traffic on port 443 from the mobile application server or other clients using the Mautic API.

### 4. Launch an Ubuntu 24.04 EC2 Instance
- Select an official Ubuntu 24.04 minimal image.
- Select an EC2 instance type. **Mautic 5 uses NPM, which is very resource heavy during the build process. In testing, t2.micro instances have failed, while t3a.medium have succeeded.**
- Attach the previously defined security groups to the instance.
- Assign the reserved Elastic IP to the instance.

### 5. Set Up SSH Key Pair
- Use an existing key pair or create a new one for secure SSH access.
- Ensure the private key is available locally for the admin performing the setup.

### 6. Test Connectivity
- Verify SSH access to the server before proceeding with the script.

### 7. Backup Strategy (Optional)
- Plan for instance snapshots or backup the server files and database regularly.
- Ensure Elastic IP and DNS records can be redirected in case of redeployment.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dliver-more/mautic-aws-server-setup.git
   cd mautic-aws-server-setup
   ```

2. Edit the shell script to customize any domain-specific or configuration-specific details. These are in the "Variables" section of the script.

3. SSH into your AWS EC2 instance:
   - Use the following command to connect to your instance via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your-private-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/your-private-key.pem` with the path to your SSH private key.
   - Replace `<your-ec2-ip>` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
   - Ensure your key permissions are secure (e.g., `chmod 400 /path/to/your-private-key.pem`).

4. Copy the script to your server or create a file and transfer the script contents:
   - **Option 1: Copy the script using `scp`**:
     ```bash
     scp setup_mautic.sh ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>:/home/ubuntu/
     ```
     - Replace `<your-ec2-ip>` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
   
   - **Option 2: Create the script file directly on the server**:
     1. Create a new file using a text editor, such as `nano`:
        ```bash
        nano setup_mautic.sh
        ```
     2. Copy the contents of `setup_mautic.sh` from your local machine.
     3. Paste the contents into the file by right-clicking in the terminal or using your clipboard paste command.
     4. Save and exit the editor (e.g., in `nano`, press `CTRL+O` to save and `CTRL+X` to exit).

5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_mautic.sh
   ./setup_mautic.sh
   ```

6. Update Security Groups:
   - After completion of setup, optionally update the security groups to remove the public access to ports 80/443
